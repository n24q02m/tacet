## 2024-05-25 - Prevented Stack Trace Leakage in FastAPI Endpoints
**Vulnerability:** The `/ask` endpoint in `src/tacet/serve/server.py` passed `str(e)` directly into the `detail` parameter of a 500 HTTP Exception response on generic catch-all errors.
**Learning:** Returning `str(e)` directly exposes raw error messages, which could leak internal application state, database schemas, or API errors directly to the client. This violates the principle of "fail securely".
**Prevention:** Changed the endpoint to log the error context server-side securely via `logging.error("Operation failed", exc_info=True)` and return a safe, generic message (`"Internal server error"`) to the client.

## 2026-07-01 - Added Security Headers Middleware to FastAPI App
**Vulnerability:** The FastAPI application was missing standard security headers (, , ), leaving it potentially vulnerable to MIME-type sniffing, clickjacking, and allowing clients to access it over unencrypted HTTP (HSTS).
**Learning:** Implementing defense-in-depth is essential; even internal or proxy-protected APIs should implement their own fundamental security headers directly via middleware in case proxy configuration fails.
**Prevention:** An  layer was added in  to globally inject standard security headers to all responses.


## 2024-05-25 - Added Security Headers Middleware to FastAPI App
**Vulnerability:** The FastAPI application was missing standard security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security), leaving it potentially vulnerable to MIME-type sniffing, clickjacking, and allowing clients to access it over unencrypted HTTP.
**Learning:** Implementing defense-in-depth is essential; even internal or proxy-protected APIs should implement their own fundamental security headers directly via middleware.
**Prevention:** An HTTP middleware layer was added in src/tacet/serve/server.py to globally inject standard security headers to all responses.
## 2025-03-08 - [DoS via Unbounded Request Models]
**Vulnerability:** Fast API Pydantic models (like `AskRequest`, `DistillRequest`, and `GraphIngestRequest`) lacked `max_length` bounds on strings and list collections, allowing attackers to potentially trigger DoS via massive payload injection.
**Learning:** In FastAPI, defining fields as `str` or `list` without bounds places no size limits natively, rendering endpoints susceptible to memory exhaustion DoS when parsing large JSON inputs. Using `typing.Annotated` is necessary for enforcing limits on nested string items within a list.
**Prevention:** Always use `Field(..., max_length=X)` for plain strings and limit array sizes via `max_length`. For elements inside arrays, wrap the type using `Annotated[str, Field(max_length=X)]` to securely bound list elements.
